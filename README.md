📊 Olist E-Commerce End-to-End Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset.
The goal is to evaluate delivery performance, seller efficiency, customer behavior, payments, cancellations, and product demand, and extract business-driven insights using SQL.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before analysis, extensive data cleaning and validation were performed across 9 relational tables to ensure accuracy and analytical reliability:
• Fixed inconsistent city and state names
• Unified product categories referring to the same meaning
• Validated and corrected datetime data types
• Verified the complete order lifecycle sequence
(purchase → approval → carrier → delivery)
• Isolated logical date inconsistencies into separate tables instead of deleting them
• Investigated zero freight values and validated that they are not data errors
• Removed only meaningless duplicates, preserving informative records
• Cleaned corrupted and broken review comments in order_reviews table
• Performed a full numeric sanity check to ensure no negative or illogical values across all numerical columns
• Checked missing values

🗂️ Data Modeling
• Built a relational data model connecting orders, sellers, customers, products, payments, and reviews using dbdiagram.io
• Ensured referential integrity across all joins
• Designed the model to support lifecycle-based and performance-based analysis

🔍 Analysis Sections
1.Delivery & Logistics Performance
• On-time vs delayed deliveries
• Delay magnitude and distribution
• Logistics vs seller responsibility 
• State-level and remote region analysis

2.Seller Performance
• Sellers contributing disproportionately to delays
• Handling time vs logistics time comparison
• Benchmarking sellers within the same customer state

3.Customer Behavior & Satisfaction
• Impact of delays on review scores
• Repeat behavior after delayed experiences
• Delay experience segmentation

4.System Performance
• Order approval time analysis
• Detection of rare system bottlenecks

5.Payments & Revenue Impact
• Payment method distribution
• Installments vs order value
• Revenue contribution by payment behavior

6.Cancellations Analysis
• Cancellation timing within order lifecycle
• Relationship with price and estimated delivery time
• Seasonal cancellation patterns

7.Products & Categories
• Most and least ordered products per category
• Category price positioning
• Seasonal demand patterns

8.Demand & Promotional Opportunities
• Identification of low-demand months for targeted offers

🧠 Key Insights
• 82% of delivery delays are logistics-dominated, while 9% are seller-dominated
• Customer satisfaction remains relatively stable across states, even in remote regions
• A small subset of sellers significantly underperform compared to regional norms
• Order approval is fast for 86% of orders, but a small fraction experiences extreme delays exceeding one week
• Installment payments increase average order value and total revenue
• Most cancellations occur after approval and before carrier, indicating seller-side issues

🛠️ Tools Used
• SQL (MySQL)
• Excel (Power Query) (Data Cleaning)
• Window Functions & CTEs
• dbdiagram.io (Data Modeling)
